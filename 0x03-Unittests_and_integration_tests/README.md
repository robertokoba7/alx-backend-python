Unittests and Integration Tests
---
The goal of a unit test is to answer the question: if everything defined outside this function works as expected, does this function work as expected?

Integration tests aim to test a code path end-to-end and hence will test interactions between every part of my code.

Am going to execute my tests wth:
`$ python -m unittest path/to/test_file.py`

Required Files are:
* utils.py
* client.py
* fixtures.py
